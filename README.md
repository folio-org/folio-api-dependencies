# FOLIO API Dependencies

This repository provides tools and resources for managing and visualizing dependencies in the FOLIO ecosystem.

## Features

A comprehensive web-based interface for exploring and analyzing FOLIO module dependencies with multiple specialized views:

- **📋 Table View**: Searchable and sortable table displaying all module dependencies with API types, versions, and app associations. Export data to CSV for further analysis.
- **🔢 API Usage Count**: Aggregated statistics showing how frequently each API is used across the FOLIO ecosystem.
- **🔎 API Usage View**: Detailed information about specific APIs, including which modules provide and consume them.
- **🌐 Module Consumers**: Interactive graph visualization showing the dependency relationships for any selected module.
- **📦 Apps**: Browse and search through all FOLIO applications with their module compositions.
- **🔗 App Dependencies**: Visual graph displaying dependencies between applications with hierarchical and circular layout options, interactive controls, and PNG export capability.
